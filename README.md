First Full Stack App

As part of Week 8 and 9 of the Bootcamp this is a full stack app to allow entry of data to a MongoDB collection.  Starting with a code-along with our tutor and some unfinished files supplied the task was to complete the code, correct any errors and develop full CRUD operations in a MERN stack. A little bit of stlye has been added which may be tweaked going forward.
